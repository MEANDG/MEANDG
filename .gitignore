# Folder tests/: a curious case:
# Do not upload the test outputs on the origin. However, keep the empty folder tests.
# The results generated by running the tests get deposited inside this folder
# So the folder tests/ is important but not whats inside of it. Thus, we ignore everything inside tests/ except for the folder itself.
# To do this, an empty file .gitkeep is kept inside of the tests. Which is commited to the origin. That keeps the folder tests.
